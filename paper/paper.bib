Coupled with Variational Beam Sectional Analysis (VABS), a general-purpose cross-sectional analysis, GEBT can effectively analyze geometric nonlinear behavior of slender structures having arbitrary cross-sections made of arbitrary materials.},

In contrast to many previously proposed beam finite element formulations the present discretization approach retains the frame-indifference (or objectivity) of the underlying beam theory. The space interpolation of rotational degrees-of-freedom is circumvented by the introduction of a reparameterization of the weak form corresponding to the equations of motion of the geometrically exact beam theory.

 abstract = {Finite element implementation of the three-dimensional finite-strain beam theory of Reissner is considered in this work. In contrast with some earlier works on the subject, discussed here are the beam elements whose reference axes are arbitrary space-curved lines. We have shown that an improved representation of curved reference geometry significantly increases the accuracy of the results. However, it also makes the choice of non-locking finite element interpolations somewhat more delicate. A hierarchical displacement interpolation proposed here is proved to be capable of eliminating both shear and membrane locking phenomena. A very satisfying non-locking performance is demonstrated for a set of problems in nonlinear elasto-statics.},
